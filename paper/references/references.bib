abstract  ="Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is broadly recognised as having the potential to play a key role in meeting climate change targets{,} delivering low carbon heat and power{,} decarbonising industry and{,} more recently{,} its ability to facilitate the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. However{,} despite this broad consensus and its technical maturity{,} CCS has not yet been deployed on a scale commensurate with the ambitions articulated a decade ago. Thus{,} in this paper we review the current state-of-the-art of CO2 capture{,} transport{,} utilisation and storage from a multi-scale perspective{,} moving from the global to molecular scales. In light of the COP21 commitments to limit warming to less than 2 °C{,} we extend the remit of this study to include the key negative emissions technologies (NETs) of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS){,} and direct air capture (DAC). Cognisant of the non-technical barriers to deploying CCS{,} we reflect on recent experience from the UK{'}s CCS commercialisation programme and consider the commercial and political barriers to the large-scale deployment of CCS. In all areas{,} we focus on identifying and clearly articulating the key research challenges that could usefully be addressed in the coming decade."}
