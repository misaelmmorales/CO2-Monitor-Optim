   abstract = {It is challenging to predict the production performance of unconventional reservoirs because of the sediment heterogeneity, intricate flow channels, and complex fluid phase behavior. The traditional oil production prediction methods (e.g., decline curve analysis and reservoir simulation modeling forecasting) are subjective. This paper presents a machine learning-based time series forecasting method, which considers the existing data as time series and extracts the salient characteristics of historical data to predict values of a future time sequence. We used time series forecasting because of the historical fluctuations in production well and reservoir operations. Three algorithms were studied and compared to address the limitations of traditional production forecasting: Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA), Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, and Prophet. This study starts with the representative oil production data from a well located in an unconventional reservoir in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin. 70% of the data was used for model training, whereas the remaining 30% of data was used to evaluate the performance of the above-mentioned methods. Then, the decline curve analysis and reservoir simulation modeling forecasting were applied for comparison. The advantages of the machine-learning models include a simple workflow, no prior assumption about the reservoir type, fast prediction, and reliable performance prediction for a typical fluctuating declining curve. More importantly, the ‘Prophet’ model captures production fluctuation caused by winter impact, which can attract the operator's attention and prevent potential failures. This has rarely been explored and discussed by previous studies. The application of ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet methods to 65 wells in the DJ Basin show that ARIMA and LSTM perform better than Prophet—probably because not all oil production data include seasonal influences. Furthermore, the wells in the nearby pads can be studied using the same parameter values in ARIMA and LSTM for predicting oil prediction in a transferred learning framework. Specifically, we observed that ARIMA is robust in predicting the oil production rate of wells across the DJ Basin.},

   abstract = {The ensemble random forest filter (ERFF) is presented as an alternative to the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for inverse modeling. The EnKF is a data assimilation approach that forecasts and updates parameter estimates sequentially in time as observations are collected. The updating step is based on the experimental covariances computed from an ensemble of realizations, and the updates are given as linear combinations of the differences between observations and forecasted system state values. The ERFF replaces the linear combination in the update step with a non-linear function represented by a random forest. This way, the non-linear relationships between the parameters to be updated and the observations can be captured, and a better update produced. The ERFF is demonstrated for log-conductivity identification from piezometric head observations in several scenarios with varying degrees of heterogeneity (log-conductivity variances going from 1 up to 6.25 (ln m/d)2), number of realizations in the ensemble (50 or 100), and number of piezometric head observations (18 or 36). In all scenarios, the ERFF works well, reconstructing the log-conductivity spatial heterogeneity while matching the observed piezometric heads at selected control points. For benchmarking purposes, the ERFF is compared to the restart EnKF to find that the ERFF is superior to the EnKF for the number of ensemble realizations used (small in typical EnKF applications). Only when the number of realizations grows to 500 the restart EnKF can match the performance of the ERFF, albeit at more than double the computational cost.},

We have developed a new generic software package for the solution of inverse problems implementing the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (genES-MDA). It is an open-source, platform-independent Python-based program. Its aim is to facilitate the management and configuration of the ES-MDA through several programming tools that help in the preparation of the different steps of ES-MDA. genES-MDA has a flexible workflow that can be easily adapted for the implementation of different variants of the ensemble Kalman filter and for the solution of generic inverse problems. This paper presents a description of the package and some application examples. genES-MDA has been tested in three synthetic case studies: the solution of the reverse flow routing for the estimation of the inflow hydrograph to a river reach using observed water levels and a calibrated forward model of the river system, the identification of a hydraulic conductivity field using piezometric observations and a known forward flow model, and the estimation of the release history of a contaminant spill in an aquifer from measured concentration data and a known flow and transport model. The results of all these tests have demonstrated the flexibility of genES-MDA and its capabilities to efficiently solve different types of inverse problems.},

   abstract = {Subsurface flow model calibration against dynamic response data is often constrained by a prior conceptual model of geologic scenario that specifies the expected spatial variability and geologic patterns in the solution. However, several sources of uncertainty exist in developing a conceptual geological model, including data limitation, process-based modeling assumptions, and subjective interpretations. Therefore, it is prudent to consider the uncertainty in geologic scenarios during model calibration and to utilize the flow response data in supporting or rejecting the proposed scenarios. We present a novel framework whereby dynamic response data is used to screen a set of proposed geologic scenarios by combining gradient-based inversion for feature extraction and convolutional neural networks for feature recognition. To compactly represent the salient features of each scenario, an extremely low-rank parameterization with the leading elements of the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is adopted. The PCA basis elements of different scenarios are combined to define the search space for feature extraction, which is implemented via an iterative least-squares inversion formulation to match the observed data. The inversion solution is obtained by selectively combining the PCA representations from different scenarios, and contains the dominant spatial patterns that are needed to match the observed data. Feature recognition to identify the relevant geologic scenarios based on the reconstructed spatial solution of feature extraction inversion is performed using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The method offers several advantages, including an efficient implementation that does not require extensive forward simulation runs, use of flow data to identify pertinent geologic scenarios, and the ability to combine geologic scenarios if supported by data. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical experiments from pumping tests in groundwater aquifers.},

We developed CCSNet, a deep-learning modeling suite that can act as an alternative to conventional numerical simulators for carbon capture and storage (CCS) problems well-represented by a 2D radial grid, for example, injection into an infinite acting saline formation with no or very small dip. CCSNet consists of a sequence of deep learning models producing all the outputs that a numerical simulator typically provides, including saturation distributions, pressure buildup, dry-out, fluid densities, mass balance, solubility trapping, and sweep efficiency.

   abstract = {Hydrogen is an integral component of the current energy transition roadmap to decarbonize the economy and create an environmentally-sustainable future. However, surface storage options (e.g., tanks) do not provide the required capacity or durability to deploy a regional or nationwide hydrogen economy. In this study, we have analyzed the technoeconomic feasibility of the geologic storage of hydrogen in depleted gas reservoirs, salt caverns, and saline aquifers in the Intermountain-West (I-WEST) region. We have identified the most favorable candidate sites for hydrogen storage and estimated the volumetric storage capacity. Our results show that the geologic storage of hydrogen can provide at least 72% of total energy consumption of the I-WEST region in 2020. We also calculated the capital and levelized costs of each storage option. We found that a depleted gas reservoir is the most cost-effective candidate among the three geologic storage options. Interestingly, the cushion gas type plays a significant role in the storage cost when we consider hydrogen. storage in saline aquifers. The levelized costs of hydrogen storage in depleted gas reservoirs, salt caverns, and saline aquifers with large-scale storage capacity are approximately $1.15, $2.50, and $3.27 per kg of H2, respectively.

Bayesian deep neural networks provide a robust framework to model uncertainty. But at a high computational cost and difficulty to scale in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Dropout offers a potential alternative for calculating prediction model realizations to represent the uncertainty model. We propose a method to compare the entire uncertainty model based on the prediction realizations and the addition of a single objective function, known as uncertainty model goodness, to the loss function to integrate model uncertainty for improved tuning of the dropout frequency in deep learning models. We test our method with a subsurface flow surrogate model based on an image-to-image regression problem. Implementing the proposed method with the uncertainty model goodness results in accurate and precise uncertainty models using the tuned dropout hyperparameter.

   abstract = {Numerical models for flow through porous media are essential for forecasting subsurface fluid flow response to support optimal decision-making to develop subsurface resources such as groundwater, geothermal, and oil and gas. For reservoir engineering, numerical flow simulation modeling is applied to support and maximize well ultimate recovery and recoverable reserves to maximize project economics and safety while minimizing environmental impacts. Subsurface models explore subsurface uncertainty based on integrating geological, geophysical, petrophysical, and reservoir engineering data and expert interpretations. To evaluate uncertainty, we rely on multiple geostatistical subsurface heterogeneity realizations paired with flow simulation forecasts to test the sensitivity of various reservoir development parameters and build an uncertainty model of reservoir performance. However, with large reservoir models, numerical flow simulation time increases, leading to a significant amount of professional time and computational effort that increases project costs, and increases cycle times resulting in delay or diminished decision quality. This issue motivates the utilization of surrogate, computationally efficient approximative flow models. Current methods focus on prediction accuracy and minimizing prediction error. When uncertainty is significant, prediction accuracy is insufficient, and we must consider the entire uncertainty distribution. We propose a new and general workflow to generate accurate and precise machine learning-based surrogate flow models to predict the relationship between the reservoir rock and fluids, development parameters, and the reservoir flow simulation responses. We train a deep convolutional neural network using the results from a three-dimensional two-phase flow simulator. Next, we use the trained model to generate ensemble predictions from the flow surrogate to evaluate the uncertainty based on the development parameters and geological information. The machine learning-based surrogate model uses exhaustive subsurface predictor features, porosity, permeability, well position, and an engineered feature representing non-dimensional time as input to predict exhaustive subsurface response features, pressure, and saturation distribution over discrete time steps as the output. The proposed workflow integrates the spatiotemporal aspect of subsurface flow modeling. It allows the practitioner engineer to explore subsurface uncertainty without the entire computational cost of numerical flow simulation to support optimum, timely development decision-making.},

   abstract = {Subsurface sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) requires long-term monitoring of the injected CO2 plume to prevent CO2 leakage along the wellbore or across the caprock. Accurate knowledge of the location and movement of the injected CO2 is crucial for risk management at a geological CO2-storage complex. Conventional methods for locating/assessing the injected CO2 plume in the subsurface assume a geophysical model, which is specific and may not be applicable to all types of CO2-injection reservoirs and scenarios. We developed an unsupervised-learning-based visualization of the subsurface CO2 plume that adapts and scales based on the data without requiring an assumption of the geophysical model. The data-processing workflow was applied to the cross-well seismic tomography data from the SECARB Cranfield carbon geo-sequestration project. A multi-level clustering approach was developed to account for data imbalance due to the absence of CO2 in the large portion of the imaged reservoir. The first level of clustering differentiated CO2-bearing regions from the non-CO2 bearing regions and achieved a silhouette score of 0.88, a Calinski-Harabasz index of 271145, and a Davies-Bouldin index of 0.30, which are indicative of high quality, reliable clustering. The second level of clustering further differentiated the CO2-bearing regions into regions containing low, medium–low, medium–high, and high CO2 content. Overall, the multi-level clustering achieved a silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index of 0.68, 86750, and 0.46, which confirm the high quality and reliability of the newly proposed unsupervised-learning-based visualization. Three distinct clustering techniques, namely k-means, mean-shift, and agglomerative, generated similar visualizations. In terms of the adjusted Rand index, the similarity of clusters identified by the three distinct clustering techniques is around 0.98, which indicates the robustness of the cluster labels assigned to various regions of the geological carbon-storage reservoir. Further, we find certain geophysical signatures, such as Fourier transform and wavelet transform, represent the distribution of CO2 content in subsurface.},

The surrogate model is based on deep convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures, specifically a residual U-Net and a convolutional long short term memory recurrent network. Training samples entail global pressure and saturation maps, at a series of time steps, generated by simulating oil-water flow in many (1500 in our case) realizations of a 2D channelized system. After training, the ‘recurrent R-U-Net’ surrogate model is shown to be capable of predicting accurate dynamic pressure and saturation maps and well rates (e.g., time-varying oil and water rates at production wells) for new geological realizations. Assessments demonstrating high surrogate-model accuracy are presented for an individual geological realization and for an ensemble of 500 test geomodels. The surrogate model is then used for the challenging problem of data assimilation (history matching) in a channelized system. For this study, posterior reservoir models are generated using the randomized maximum likelihood method, with the permeability field represented using the recently developed CNN-PCA parameterization. The flow responses required during the data assimilation procedure are provided by the recurrent R-U-Net. The overall approach is shown to lead to substantial reduction in prediction uncertainty. High-fidelity numerical simulation results for the posterior geomodels (generated by the surrogate-based data assimilation procedure) are shown to be in essential agreement with the recurrent R-U-Net predictions. Comparisons to simulation-based data assimilation results further highlight the accuracy and applicability of the recurrent R-U-Net, and suggest that it may enable the use of more formal posterior sampling methods in realistic problems.},

We develop a deep learning-accelerated workflow to assimilate surface displacement maps interpreted from InSAR and to forecast dynamic reservoir pressure. Employing an Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework, the workflow updates three-dimensional (3D) geologic properties and predicts reservoir pressure with quantified uncertainties. We use a synthetic commercial-scale GCS model with bimodally distributed permeability and porosity to demonstrate the efficacy of the workflow. A two-step CNN-PCA approach is employed to parameterize the bimodal fields. The computational efficiency of the workflow is boosted by two residual U-Net based surrogate models for surface displacement and reservoir pressure predictions, respectively.

   abstract = {Production optimization under geological uncertainty is computationally expensive, as a large number of well control schedules must be evaluated over multiple geological realizations. In this work, a convolutional-recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) proxy model is developed to predict well-by-well oil and water rates, for given time-varying well bottom-hole pressure (BHP) schedules, for each realization in an ensemble. This capability enables the estimation of the objective function and nonlinear constraint values required for robust optimization. The proxy model represents an extension of a recently developed long short-term memory (LSTM) RNN proxy designed to predict well rates for a single geomodel. A CNN is introduced here to processes permeability realizations, and this provides the initial states for the RNN. The CNN-RNN proxy is trained using simulation results for 300 different sets of BHP schedules and permeability realizations. We demonstrate proxy accuracy for oil-water flow through multiple realizations of 3D multi-Gaussian permeability models. The proxy is then incorporated into a closed-loop reservoir management (CLRM) workflow, where it is used with particle swarm optimization and a filter-based method for nonlinear constraint satisfaction. History matching is achieved using an adjoint-gradient-based procedure. The proxy model is shown to perform well in this setting for five different (synthetic) 'true' models.

   abstract = {In subsurface flow settings, data assimilation/history matching presents computational challenges because many high-fidelity models must be simulated. Various deep-learning-based surrogate modeling techniques have been developed to reduce the simulation costs associated with these applications. However, to construct data-driven surrogate models, several thousand high-fidelity simulation runs may be required to provide training samples, and these computations can make training prohibitively expensive. To address this issue, in this work we present a framework where most of the training simulations are performed on coarsened (low-fidelity) geomodels. These models are constructed using a flow-based upscaling method. The framework entails the use of a transfer-learning procedure, incorporated within an existing recurrent residual U-Net architecture, in which network training is accomplished in three steps. In the first step, where the bulk of the training is performed, only low-fidelity simulation results are used. The second and third steps, in which the output layer is trained and the overall network is fine-tuned, require a relatively small number of high-fidelity simulations. Here we use 2500 low-fidelity runs and 200 high-fidelity runs, which leads to about a 90% reduction in training simulation costs. The method is applied for two-phase subsurface flow in 3D channelized systems, with flow driven by wells. The surrogate model trained with multifidelity data is shown to be nearly as accurate as a reference surrogate trained with only high-fidelity data in predicting dynamic pressure and saturation fields in new geomodels. Importantly, the network provides results that are significantly more accurate than the low-fidelity simulations used for most of the training. The multifidelity surrogate is also applied for history matching using an ensemble-based procedure, where accuracy relative to reference results is again demonstrated.},

A predictive data-driven model was developed to understand the well's performance and forecast the gas production using DTS data and daily flowing time as dynamic inputs, from May 2016 to May 2018. We used 1320 DTS measurements along the lateral of the well MIP-3H for each day and upscaled to a stage scale by an averaging method. A multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) was trained with stage-based daily DTS data, and daily flowing time to predict gas production for the next day. We carried out a sensitivity analysis by removing each stage DTS attribute from the input dataset to identify the most influential stages in predicting gas production. The sensitivity analysis (SA) shows that several stages carry higher weights in predicting gas production, while several stages have less impact on prediction accuracy. In contrast to DTS, DAS data was only recorded during hydraulic fracturing of the well. DAS energy variance attribute, which could be inversely related to stage stimulation efficiency, was computed for each stage and compared with the results of the neural network SA. Stages with higher variance in DAS energy (less efficient stimulation) have less effect on neural network accuracy. This relationship is more significant for stages that are completed with limited entry approach in zones with similar minimum horizontal stress. The results of the sensitivity analysis was also compared with flow scanner production logging data. Results suggests that DAS data is more correlated with sensitivity analysis results than production logging data.},

   abstract = {Seismic data provides integral information in geophysical exploration, for locating hydrocarbon rich areas as well as for fracture monitoring during well stimulation. Because of its high frequency acquisition rate and dense spatial sampling, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has seen increasing application in microseimic monitoring. Given large volumes of data to be analyzed in real-time and impractical memory and storage requirements, fast compression and accurate interpretation methods are necessary for real-time monitoring campaigns using DAS. In response to the developments in data acquisition, we have created shifted-matrix decomposition (SMD) to compress seismic data by storing it into pairs of singular vectors coupled with shift vectors. This is achieved by shifting the columns of a matrix of seismic data before applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to it to extract a pair of singular vectors. The purpose of SMD is data denoising as well as compression, as reconstructing seismic data from its compressed form creates a denoised version of the original data. By analyzing the data in its compressed form, we can also run signal detection and velocity estimation analysis. Therefore, the developed algorithm can simultaneously compress and denoise seismic data while also analyzing compressed data to estimate signal presence and wave velocities. To show its efficiency, we compare SMD to local SVD and structure-oriented SVD, which are similar SVD-based methods used only for denoising seismic data. While the development of SMD is motivated by the increasing use of DAS, SMD can be applied to any seismic data obtained from a large number of receivers. For example, here we present initial applications of SMD to readily available marine seismic data.},

   abstract = {Data-driven methods have been revolutionizing the way physicists and engineers handle complex and challenging problems even when the physics is not fully understood. However, these models very often lack interpretability. Physics-aware machine learning (ML) techniques have been used to endow proxy models with features closely related to the ones encountered in nature; examples span from material balance to conservation laws. In this study, we proposed a hybrid-based approach that incorporates physical constraints (physics-based) and yet is driven by input/output data (data-driven), leading to fast, reliable, and interpretable reservoir simulation models. To this end, we built on a recently developed deep learning–based reduced-order modeling framework by adding a new step related to information on the input–output behavior (e.g., well rates) of the reservoir and not only the states (e.g., pressure and saturation) matching. A deep-neural network (DNN) architecture is used to predict the state variables evolution after training an autoencoder coupled with a control system approach (Embed to Control—E2C) along with the addition of some physical components (loss functions) to the neural network training procedure. Here, we extend this idea by adding the simulation model output, for example, well bottom-hole pressure and well flow rates, as data to be used in the training procedure. Additionally, we introduce a new architecture to the E2C transition model by adding a new neural network component to handle the connections between state variables and model outputs. By doing this, it is possible to estimate the evolution in time of both the state and output variables simultaneously. Such a non-intrusive data-driven method does not need to have access to the reservoir simulation internal structure, so it can be easily applied to commercial reservoir simulators. The proposed method is applied to an oil–water model with heterogeneous permeability, including four injectors and five producer wells. We used 300 sampled well control sets to train the autoencoder and another set to validate the obtained autoencoder parameters. We show our proxy’s accuracy and robustness by running two different neural network architectures (propositions 2 and 3), and we compare our results with the original E2C framework developed for reservoir simulation.},

   abstract = {Data-space inversion (DSI) is a data assimilation procedure that directly generates posterior flow predictions, for time series of interest, without calibrating model parameters. No forward flow simulation is performed in the data assimilation process. DSI instead uses the prior data generated by performing (Formula presented.) simulations on prior geomodel realizations. Data parameterization is useful in the DSI framework as it enables representation of the correlated time-series data quantities in terms of low-dimensional latent-space variables. In this work, a recently developed parameterization based on a recurrent autoencoder (RAE) is applied with DSI for a real naturally fractured reservoir. The parameterization, involving the use of a recurrent neural network and an autoencoder, is able to capture important correlations in the time-series data. RAE training is accomplished using flow simulation results for 1,350 prior model realizations. An ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) is applied to provide posterior DSI data samples. The modeling in this work is much more complex than that considered in previous DSI studies as it includes multiple 3D discrete fracture realizations, three-phase flow, tracer injection and production, and complicated field-management logic leading to frequent well shut-in and reopening. Results for the reconstruction of new simulation data (not seen in training), using both the RAE-based parameterization and a simpler approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) with histogram transformation, are presented. The RAE-based procedure is shown to provide better accuracy for these data reconstructions. Detailed posterior DSI results are then presented for a particular “true” model (which is outside the prior ensemble), and summary results are provided for five additional “true” models that are consistent with the prior ensemble. These results again demonstrate the advantages of DSI with RAE-based parameterization for this challenging fractured reservoir case.},

Physics-based models are to a certain extent exact, but they entail heavy computational infrastructure for simulating a wide variety of parameters and production scenarios. Reduced-order models offer computational advantages without compromising solution accuracy, especially if they can assimilate large volumes of production data without having to reconstruct the original model (data-driven models). Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) entails the extraction of relevant spatial structure (modes) based on data (snapshots) that can be used to predict the behavior of reservoir fluid flow in porous media. In this paper, we will further enhance the application of the DMD, by introducing sparse DMD and local DMD. The former is particularly useful when there is a limited number of sparse measurements as in the case of reservoir simulation, and the latter can improve the accuracy of developed DMD models when the process dynamics show a moving boundary behavior like hydraulic fracturing. For demonstration purposes, we first show the methodology applied to (flow only) single- and two-phase reservoir models using the SPE10 benchmark. Both online and offline processes will be used for evaluation. We observe that we only require a few DMD modes, which are determined by the sparse DMD structure, to capture the behavior of the reservoir models. Then, we applied the local DMDc for creating a proxy for application in a hydraulic fracturing process. We also assessed the trade-offs between problem size and computational time for each reservoir model. The novelty of our method is the application of sparse DMD and local DMDc, which is a data-driven technique for fast and accurate simulations.},

   abstract = {Integration of 3D and time-lapse 4D seismic data into reservoir modelling and history matching processes poses a significant challenge due to the frequent mismatch between the initial reservoir model, the true reservoir geology, and the pre-production (baseline) seismic data. A fundamental step of a reservoir characterisation and performance study is the preconditioning of the initial reservoir model to equally honour both the geological knowledge and seismic data. In this paper we analyse the issues that have a significant impact on the (mis)match of the initial reservoir model with well logs and inverted 3D seismic data. These issues include the constraining methods for reservoir lithofacies modelling, the sensitivity of the results to the presence of realistic resolution and noise in the seismic data, the geostatistical modelling parameters, and the uncertainties associated with quantitative incorporation of inverted seismic data in reservoir lithofacies modelling. We demonstrate that in a geostatistical lithofacies simulation process, seismic constraining methods based on seismic litho-probability curves and seismic litho-probability cubes yield the best match to the reference model, even when realistic resolution and noise is included in the dataset. In addition, our analyses show that quantitative incorporation of inverted 3D seismic data in static reservoir modelling carries a range of uncertainties and should be cautiously applied in order to minimise the risk of misinterpretation. These uncertainties are due to the limited vertical resolution of the seismic data compared to the scale of the geological heterogeneities, the fundamental instability of the inverse problem, and the non-unique elastic properties of different lithofacies types.},

   abstract = {Time-lapse seismic data are generally used to monitor the changes in dynamic reservoir properties such as fluid saturation and pore or effective pressure. Changes in saturation and pressure due to hydrocarbon production usually cause changes in the seismic velocities and as a consequence changes in seismic amplitudes and travel times. This work proposes a new rock physics model to describe the relation between saturation-pressure changes and seismic changes and a probabilistic workflow to quantify the changes in saturation and pressure from time-lapse seismic changes. In the first part of this work, we propose a new quadratic approximation of the rock physics model. The novelty of the proposed formulation is that the coefficients of the model parameters (i.e. the saturation-pressure changes) are functions of the porosity, initial saturation and initial pressure. The improvements in the results of the forward model are shown through some illustrative examples. In the second part of the work, we present a Bayesian inversion approach for saturation-pressure 4D inversion in which we adopt the new formulation of the rock physics approximation. The inversion results are validated using synthetic pseudo-logs and a 3D reservoir model for CO2 sequestration.},

   abstract = {This paper presents Latent-Space Inversion (LSI) as a new data-informed inversion and parameterization framework where dimensionality reduction is tailored to flow physics that governs the behavior of subsurface systems. Inverse modeling in hydrogeology and petroleum engineering involves minimizing the mismatch between observed and simulated data from a set of prior models. A myriad of approaches has been developed to accomplish this goal over the years, and their performance is dependent on the effectiveness of parameterization and the capability of data conditioning technique. We demonstrate LSI as a more robust and efficient approach for calibration of subsurface model over traditional approaches where dimensionality reduction of model parameters is done independently (decoupled) of flow data integration. LSI provides a compact description of the parameters in a latent space that does not only exploit the redundancy of large-scale geologic features but also retain features that are sensitive to flow data. Motivated by recent advances in machine learning research, LSI architecture involves a pair of deep convolutional autoencoders that are coupled to jointly extract spatial geologic features in subsurface models and temporal trends in flow data. The LSI architecture is trained offline using prior model realizations and their corresponding simulated flow responses (as training data) to effectively represent the model and data and to learn the complex nonlinear inverse mapping between data and model. Once field data becomes available, calibrated models can be rapidly obtained using the trained LSI architecture. The resulting data-informed model latent space can be explored to allow the generation of an ensemble of calibrated model realizations around the inversion solution. This is especially useful when observed data is noisy and multiple inversion solutions can be accepted within the noise range. We present several inversion examples to illustrate the performance of LSI and to discuss the advantages and limitations of data-driven inversion approaches compared to the conventional inverse modelling formulations.},

   abstract = {Deep learning techniques are increasingly being considered for geological applications where—much like in computer vision—the challenges are characterized by high-dimensional spatial data dominated by multipoint statistics. In particular, a novel technique called generative adversarial networks has been recently studied for geological parametrization and synthesis, obtaining very impressive results that are at least qualitatively competitive with previous methods. The method obtains a neural network parametrization of the geology—so-called a generator—that is capable of reproducing very complex geological patterns with dimensionality reduction of several orders of magnitude. Subsequent works have addressed the conditioning task, i.e., using the generator to generate realizations honoring spatial observations (hard data). The current approaches, however, do not provide a parametrization of the conditional generation process. In this work, we propose a method to obtain a parametrization for direct generation of conditional realizations. The main idea is to simply extend the existing generator network by stacking a second inference network that learns to perform the conditioning. This inference network is a neural network trained to sample a posterior distribution derived using a Bayesian formulation of the conditioning task. The resulting extended neural network thus provides the conditional parametrization. Our method is assessed on a benchmark image of binary channelized subsurface, obtaining very promising results for a wide variety of conditioning configurations.},

   abstract = {Data-space inversion (DSI) and related procedures represent a family of methods applicable for data assimilation in subsurface flow settings. These methods differ from usual model-based techniques in that they provide only posterior predictions for quantities (time series) of interest, not posterior models with calibrated parameters. DSI methods require a large number (O(500-1000)) of flow simulations to first be performed on prior geological realizations. Given observed data, posterior predictions for time series of interest, such as well injection or production rates, can then be generated directly. DSI operates in a Bayesian setting and provides posterior samples of the data vector. In this work, we develop and evaluate a new approach for data parameterization in DSI. Parameterization is useful in DSI as it reduces the number of variables to determine in the inversion, and it maintains the physical character of the data variables. The new parameterization uses a recurrent autoencoder (RAE) for dimension reduction, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network architecture to represent flow-rate time series. The RAE-based parameterization is combined with an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) for posterior data sample generation. Results are presented for two-and three-phase flows in a 2D channelized system and a 3D multi-Gaussian model. The new DSI RAE procedure, along with several existing DSI treatments, is assessed through detailed comparison to reference rejection sampling (RS) results. The new DSI methodology is shown to consistently outperform existing approaches, in terms of statistical (P 10-P 90 interval and Mahalanobis distance) agreement with RS results. The method is also shown to accurately capture derived quantities which are computed from variables considered directly in DSI. This requires correlation and covariance between variables to be properly captured, and accuracy in these relationships is demonstrated. The RAE-based parameterization developed here is clearly useful in DSI, and it may also find application in other subsurface flow problems.},

Against the limitations of the huge computational consumption and complex parameterization of geostatistics-based stochastic simulation methods, we propose an automatic reconstruction method of 3D geological models based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN). In this work, 2D geological sections are used as conditioning data to generate 3D geological models automatically. Various realizations can be reproduced under a same DCGAN model established through deep network training. A U-Net structure is used to enhance the fitting effect of the DCGAN model. In addition, joint loss functions are exploited to increase the similarity between 3D realizations and reference models. Three synthetic datasets were used to verify the capability of the method presented in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed 3D automatic reconstruction method based on DCGAN can capture the features, trends and spatial patterns of geological structures well. The output models obey the used conditioning data. The complex heterogeneous structures are reconstructed more accurately and quickly by using the proposed method.},

These optimizations are computationally expensive due to the large number of multiphase flow simulations that must be conducted. In this work, we present an optimization framework in which these simulations are performed with low-fidelity (LF) models. These LF models are constructed from the underlying high-fidelity (HF) geomodel using a global transmissibility upscaling procedure. Tree-based machine-learning methods, specifically random forest and light gradient boosting machine, are applied to estimate the error in objective function value (in this case net present value, NPV) associated with the LF models. In the offline (preprocessing) step, preliminary optimizations are performed using LF models, and a clustering procedure is applied to select a representative set of 100-150 well configurations to use for training. HF simulation is then performed for these configurations, and the tree-based models are trained using an appropriate set of features. In the online (runtime) step, optimization with LF models, with the machine-learning correction, is conducted. Differential evolution is used for all optimizations. Results are presented for two example cases involving the placement of vertical wells in 3D bimodal channelized geomodels. We compare the performance of our procedure to optimization using HF models. In the first case, 25 optimization runs are performed with both approaches. Our method provides an overall speedup factor of 46 relative to optimization using HF models, with the best-case NPV within 1% of the HF result. In the second case fewer HF optimization runs are conducted (consistent with actual practice), and the overall speedup factor with our approach is about 8. In this case, the best-case NPV from our procedure exceeds the HF result by 3.8%.},

   abstract = {The 3D reconstruction of porous media plays a key role in many engineering applications. There are two main methods for the reconstruction of porous media: physical experimental methods and numerical reconstruction methods. The former are usually expensive and restricted by the limited size of experimental samples, while the latter are relatively cost-effective but still suffer from a lengthy processing time and unsatisfactory performance. With the vigorous development of deep learning in recent years, applying deep learning methods to 3D reconstruction of porous media has become an important direction. Variational auto-encoder (VAE) is one of the typical deep learning methods with a strong ability of extracting features from training images (TIs), but it has the problem of posterior collapse, meaning the generated data from the decoder are not related to its input data, i.e. the latent space Z. This paper proposes a VAE model (called SE-FBN-VAE) based on squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet) and fixed batch normalization (FBN) for the reconstruction of porous media. SENet is a simple and efficient channel attention mechanism, which improves the sensitivity of the model to channel characteristics. The application of SENet to VAE can further improve its ability of extracting features from TIs. Batch normalization (BN) is a common method for data normalization in neural networks, which reduces the convergence time of the network. In this paper, BN is slightly modified to solve the problem of posterior collapse of VAE. Compared with some other numerical methods, the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method are demonstrated.},

   abstract = {Recently, many researchers have focused on reservoir production optimization because it is one of the most essential processes in closed-loop reservoir management. Surrogate-assisted production optimization in particular has received a lot of research attention. This technique applies a simple yet vigorous approximation model to substitute expensive numerical simulation runs. However, almost all the existing methods independently use a single approximation model and neglect the potential synergies between these models. In order to make full use of the potential synergies of these existing approximation models, a novel multi-fidelity (MF) surrogate-assisted multi-objective production optimization (MOPO) method based on transfer stacking (MFTS-MOPO) is proposed. In the MFTS-MOPO method, the radial basis function network and support vector regression surrogate models are applied to approximate the high-fidelity (HF) model as the two additional low-fidelity (LF) models. Then a multi-fidelity surrogate model is adopted to evaluate objectives during the optimization process by transferring the two additional and streamline low-fidelity models to the computationally expensive high-fidelity model. Furthermore, two sampling infill strategies are applied to efficiently improve the quality of the multi-fidelity surrogate model. The uniqueness of the proposed MFTS-MOPO method is that the transfer stacking technique is employed to efficiently use the information from different fidelity models to establish the MF surrogate model and the infill sampling strategy used to improve its performance. In addition, three benchmark problems and two reservoirs with different scales were applied to illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the MFTS-MOPO method. It was found that the MFTS-MOPO method had superior performance in convergence and diversity than other conventional methods.},

In this context, machine learning techniques can be used as an alternative to perform the upscaling of porous media properties with lower computational cost than traditional upscaling methods. Hence, in this work, an upscaling methodology is proposed to compute the equivalent permeability on the large grid through convolutional neural networks (CNN). This method achieves suitable precision, with less computational demand, when evaluated on 2D and 3D models, if compared with the local upscaling approach.

However, such methods rely on limited flow physics and are based on various assumptions about the data, and subsurface, geological, and engineering settings.

However, kriging and its variants (such as regression kriging, in which auxiliary variables or derivatives of these are included as covariates) are relatively restrictive models and lack capabilities provided by deep neural networks. Principal among these is feature learning: the ability to learn filters to recognise task-relevant patterns in gridded data such as images. Here, we demonstrate the power of feature learning in a geostatistical context by showing how deep neural networks can automatically learn the complex high-order patterns by which point-sampled target variables relate to gridded auxiliary variables (such as those provided by remote sensing) and in doing so produce detailed maps. In order to cater for the needs of decision makers who require well-calibrated probabilities, we also demonstrate how both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty can be quantified in our deep learning approach via a Bayesian approximation known as Monte Carlo dropout. In our example, we produce a national-scale probabilistic geochemical map from point-sampled observations with auxiliary data provided by a terrain elevation grid.

While traditional geostatistical approaches are still commonly used nowadays, deep learning is gaining a lot of attention within geosci-entific community for generating subsurface models, as a result of recent advance of computing powers and increasing availability of training data sets. This work presents a deep learning approach for geological facies modeling based on generative adver-sarial networks (GANs) combined with training-image-based simulation. In a typical application of learned networks, all neural network parameters are fixed after training, and the uncertainty in the trained model cannot be analyzed. To address this problem , a Bayesian GANs (BGANs) approach is proposed to create facies models. In this approach, a probability distribution is assigned to the neural parameters of the BGANs. Only neural parameters of the generator in BGANs are assigned with a probability function, and the ones in the discriminator are treated as fixed. Random samples are then drawn from the posterior distribution of neural parameters to simulate subsurface facies models. The proposed approach is applied to the two different geological depo-sitional scenarios, fluvial channels and carbonate mounds, and the generated models reasonably capture the variability of the training/testing data. Meanwhile, the model uncertainty of learned networks is readily accessible. To fully sample the spatial distribution in the training image set, a large collection of samples of network parameters is required to be drawn from the posterior distribution, thus significantly increasing computational cost.

   abstract = {One of the main problems associated with applying data assimilation methods for facies models is the lack of geological plausibility in updates. This issue is even more acute for channelized reservoirs, knowing that, without a reliable parameterization, the geometrical structure of the channels can hardly be reproduced in the updated step of any data assimilation method. This paper presents a new methodology for estimation and uncertainty quantification of facies fields in channelized reservoirs, bridging a deep convolutional autoencoder with an ensemble-based method. The proposed methodology is suitable for any geological simulation model and does not use the resampling from the training image when using a multipoint geostatistical simulation model. Besides the channel estimation, the proposed methodology preserves the geological plausibility in the updated step of the history-matching method. The new methodology employs, inside the parameterization, a deep convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct the channel geometry. The convolutional autoencoder is used for image reconstruction purposes. The input of the training set of the autoencoder consists of images (facies fields) generated with a parameterization of the facies fields and perturbed with a Gaussian noise having spatial correlation. This procedure ensures the consistency of the method in the sense that the input fields have a similar structure with the facies fields obtained after the history matching. The methodology is tested for channelized reservoirs, with different levels of complexity, and also by comparison with previous methods that use or not resampling from the training image. The results show an improvement in the geological plausibility, estimation, and uncertainty quantification of the channel distributions while achieving a good data match.},

   abstract = {Groundwater modeling is an important tool for water resources management and aquifer remediation. However, the inherent strong heterogeneity of the subsurface and scarcity of observed data pose major challenges for groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling. Data assimilation such as the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) can be used to improve the understanding of the subsurface by integrating a variety of data into the modeling. For highly heterogeneous aquifers such as fluvial deposits, traditional data assimilation methods cannot preserve geological structures. In this work, two of the most popular deep learning methods, Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), are compared for identifying geological structures using flow and transport data assimilation. Specifically, VAE and GAN are used to re-parameterize the hydraulic conductivity fields with low dimensional latent variables. The ES-MDA then is used to update the latent variables by assimilating the observed data such as hydraulic head and contaminant concentration into the model. Synthetic examples of both categorical and continuous variables are conducted to test the performance of coupling ES-MDA with VAE or GAN. The results demonstrate that the generating quality of GAN is better such that channels are generated with similar properties as in the training image, while VAE has the advantage that data assimilation is more successful in allowing better localization of the actual channels for the considered inverse problem.},

   abstract = {Data assimilation methods are commonly used to predict petrophysical properties of deep saline aquifers for carbon dioxide sequestration studies. However, data assimilation is usually computationally challenging for large-scale geological models with a large number of geophysical observations. A computationally efficient method is developed for large-scale data assimilation problems. In the proposed method, model parameters and observations are reduced by randomized tensor decomposition, and the inversion is performed in lower-dimensional spaces. Tensors are multiway arrays that generalize matrices to multiple dimensions and therefore provide a natural way to represent three-dimensional geological models and geophysical measurements. To exploit the inherent multidimensional structure of tensors, high-order singular value decomposition performs orthogonal decomposition of the tensor in the high-order space instead of using a flattened matrix representation. However, for complex geological models, the dimension of tensors becomes very large, making the decomposition computationally unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, the dimension of the tensors is first reduced by a randomized linear algebra algorithm which guarantees that most of the information of the original tensors is preserved with high probability in the reduced tensor, and then high-order singular value decomposition is applied on the smaller tensors with relatively small computational cost. By using randomized tensor decomposition for model and data re-parameterization, data assimilation is efficiently performed in the low-dimensional model and data space. The proposed method is demonstrated and validated on the three-dimensional data set synthesized based on the Johansen formation, a potential carbon dioxide storage site offshore in Norway.},

   abstract = {The choice of a prior model can have a large impact on the ability to assimilate data. In standard applications of ensemble-based data assimilation, all realizations in the initial ensemble are generated from the same covariance matrix with the implicit assumption that this covariance is appropriate for the problem. In a hierarchical approach, the parameters of the covariance function, for example, the variance, the orientation of the anisotropy and the ranges in two principal directions, may all be uncertain. Thus, the hierarchical approach is much more robust against model misspecification. In this paper, three approaches to sampling from the posterior for hierarchical parameterizations are discussed: an optimization-based sampling approach (randomized maximum likelihood, RML), an iterative ensemble smoother (IES), and a novel hybrid of the previous two approaches (hybrid IES). The three approximate sampling methods are applied to a linear-Gaussian inverse problem for which it is possible to compare results with an exact “marginal-then-conditional” approach. Additionally, the IES and the hybrid IES methods are tested on a two-dimensional flow problem with uncertain anisotropy in the prior covariance. The standard IES method is shown to perform poorly in the flow examples because of the poor representation of the local sensitivity matrix by the ensemble-based method. The hybrid method, however, samples well even with a relatively small ensemble size.},

   abstract = {Machine-learning-based proxy models are often used to replace many of the flow simulations required in optimizations of subsurface flow processes. Because the optimizer continuously shifts the solution toward promising regions of search space, the proxy must provide predictions outside its original training range. This requires retraining, as proxy models typically have limited extrapolation capabilities. In this work, detailed procedures for continuous proxy retraining are presented and evaluated. The basic proxy is an artificial neural network, and it is implemented in an iterative Latin hypercube sampling optimization procedure. At many optimization iterations, a fraction of the required function evaluations are performed using the proxy, and a fraction are via flow simulation. These simulation results are used to update the proxy, resulting in a dynamic strategy. The procedure is applied to two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of oil production via water injection, with wells operating under bottom-hole pressure control. Results demonstrate the advantages of the dynamic proxy strategy relative to a standard (fully simulation-based) approach. For the three-dimensional case, for example, with about the same number of numerical simulations, the proxy-based method gives a net present value (NPV) that exceeds that of the standard approach by 3.25%. In addition, the proxy strategy requires less than a third of the numerical simulations to achieve the same NPV as the standard procedure. The general strategy should be applicable with different optimizers for a range of optimization problems.},

   abstract = {Constructing subsurface models that accurately reproduce geological heterogeneity and their associated uncertainty is critical to many geoscience and engineering applications. For hydrocarbon reservoir modeling and forecasting, for example, spatial variability must be consistent with geological processes, geophysical measurements, and time records of fluid production measurements. Generating such subsurface models can be time-consuming; conditioning them to different types of measurements is even more computationally intensive and technically challenging. Using too many free variables can cause overfitting of the data, thereby decreasing the predictive ability of the model; high dimensionality also slows convergence during history matching of fluid production measurements. To contend with these problems, we introduce here a new machine learning approach, referred to as the stochastic pix2pix method, which parameterizes high-dimensional, stochastic reservoir models into low-dimensional Gaussian random variables in latent space. Many of the world’s significant hydrocarbon fields originate from fluvial or turbidite deposits, with sedimentary processes and spatial distribution of rock facies significantly influencing their flow behavior. Rule- or object-based methods are commonly used to model geostatistically these types of reservoirs. Here, we introduce a new and efficient machine learning-based reservoir modeling workflow capable of generating 2D fluvial reservoir models that account for the available field data and the geometries of different facies. By constraining subsurface model realizations to available geophysical and petrophysical interpretations, multiphysics inversion can be greatly accelerated, thereby requiring only production history matching. Although our models are 2D, an extension to 3D can be readily implemented through zone-by-zone (i.e., reservoir unit) modeling and conditioning. The proposed method and workflow also partially solve the common problem of machine learning methods, wherein mapping low- to high-resolution images often yield reduced spatial variability. The proposed method is an extension of conditional generative adversarial networks, in which we incorporate a novel penalty term into the loss function in order to generate various realizations honoring the same conditional data, such as structural interpretation from seismic data, and borehole measurements at key well locations. We “train” the generative model on geologically realistic, multivariate spatial models generated with a rule-based fluvial reservoir simulator. Each high-resolution training image includes five lithofacies with distinct petrophysical property trends. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, visual inspection, indicator variograms and multiple point density function are applied to gauge how well the realizations reproduce existing patterns in the true model. A new metric, the mean categorical error, is proposed to quantify how well the realizations match the conditioning data. The proposed method correctly reproduces patterns even when the conditioning data are significantly different from those in the training set. Likewise, the method can perform continuous model modifications, meaning that the machine learning procedure effectively reproduces the migration rule of a meandering (fluvial) system.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for generating 3-dimensional complex geological facies models based on deep generative models. It can reproduce a wide range of conceptual geological models while possessing the flexibility necessary to honor constraints such as well data. Compared with existing geostatistics-based modeling methods, our approach produces realistic subsurface facies architecture in 3D using a state-of-the-art deep learning method called generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs couple a generator with a discriminator, and each uses a deep convolutional neural network. The networks are trained in an adversarial manner until the generator can create “fake” images that the discriminator cannot distinguish from “real” images. We extend the original GAN approach to 3D geological modeling at the reservoir scale. The GANs are trained using a library of 3D facies models. Once the GANs have been trained, they can generate a variety of geologically realistic facies models constrained by well data interpretations. This geomodelling approach using GANs has been tested on models of both complex fluvial depositional systems and carbonate reservoirs that exhibit progradational and aggradational trends. The results demonstrate that this deep learning-driven modeling approach can capture more realistic facies architectures and associations than existing geostatistical modeling methods, which often fail to reproduce heterogeneous nonstationary sedimentary facies with apparent depositional trend.},

This work describes a deep learning (DL) workflow to predict the pressure evolution as fluid flows in large-scale 3-dimensional(3D) heterogeneous porous media. In particular, we develop an efficient feature coarsening technique to extract the most representative information and perform the training and prediction of DL at the coarse scale, and further recover the resolution at the fine scale by spatial interpolation. We validate the DL approach to predict pressure field against physics-based simulation data for a field-scale 3D geologic $$CO_2$$ sequestration reservoir model. We evaluate the impact of feature coarsening on DL performance, and observe that the feature coarsening not only decreases the training time by $$&gt;74\%$$ and reduces the memory consumption by $$&gt;75\%$$ , but also maintains temporal error $$0.63\%$$ on average. Besides, the DL workflow provides predictive efficiency with 1406 times speedup compared to physics-based numerical simulation. The key findings from this research significantly improve the training and prediction efficiency of deep learning model to deal with large-scale heterogeneous reservoir models, and thus it can also be further applied to accelerate workflows of history matching and reservoir optimization for close-loop reservoir management.},

   abstract = {Reservoir model calibration against dynamic response data is often constrained by a prior conceptual model of geologic scenario that specifies the expected types of spatial variability and features in the solution. However, geologists have significant uncertainty in developing a conceptual model, e.g., due to limited data, process-based modeling assumptions, and subjectivity. Therefore, it is prudent to consider the uncertainty in the geologic scenario when solving the model calibration problem as it will provide an opportunity to utilize the response data in supporting or rejecting the proposed scenarios. We present a new approach for geologic scenario identification based on dynamic response data by combining gradient-based inversion for feature extraction and a convolutional neural network for feature recognition. To compactly represent each scenario while ensuring data sensitivity, the approach relies on extremely low-rank parameterization of individual geologic scenarios based on the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The PCA basis elements of each scenario are then combined to capture the salient features in any of the scenarios, or their possible combinations. An iterative least-squares formulation is then formulated to detect scenarios that are supported by the observed data. The inversion results in an approximate (smooth) spatial solution that contains the dominant spatial patterns. A pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is then used to identify the relevant geologic scenarios based on the reconstructed spatial solution. Two main advantages of the workflow include: (i) the ability to combine different scenarios if supported by data, instead of evaluating individual scenarios, and (ii) efficient gradient-based implementation that does not require extensive forward simulation runs. In addition, the training of CNN is implemented using only geologic realizations without requiring additional reservoir simulation. The performance of the workflow is evaluated using tomographic inversion and model calibration in fluvial reservoirs.},

   abstract = {Reservoir simulation is the most widely used tool for oil and gas production forecasting and reservoir management. Solving a large-scale system of nonlinear differential equations every timestep can be computationally expensive. In this work, we present a two-phase physics-constrained deep-learning reduced-order model as a surrogate model for subsurface flow production forecast. The implemented deep learning model is a physics-guided encoder-decoder, constructed based on the Embed-to-Control (E2C) framework. In our implementation, the E2C works in a way analogous to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition combined with Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (POD-DEIM) or Trajectory PieceWise Linearization approach (POD-TPWL). The E2C-Reduced-order model (ROM) involves projecting the system from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional subspace using the encoder-decoder, approximating the progression of the system from one timestep to the next using a linear transition model, and finally projecting the system back to high-dimensional space using the encoder-decoder. To guarantee mass conservation, we adopt the Finite Elements Mixed Formulation in the neural network's loss function combined with the original data-based loss function. Training simulations are generated using a full-physics reservoir simulator (IPARS). High-fidelity pressure, velocity, and saturation solution snapshot at constant time intervals are taken as training input to the neural network. After training, the model is tested over large variations of well control settings. Accurate pressure and saturation solutions are predicted along with the injection and production well quantities using the proposed approach. Errors in the predicted quantities of interest are reduced with the increase in the number of training simulations used. Although it required a large number of training simulations for the offline (training) step, the model achieved a significant speedup in the online stage compared to the full physics model. Considering the overall computational cost, this ROM model is proper for cases when a large number of simulations are required like in the case of production optimization and uncertainty assessments. The proposed approach shows the capability of the deep-learning reduced-order model to accurately predict multiphase flow behavior such as well quantities, and global pressure and saturation fields. The model honors mass conservation and the underlying physics laws, which many existing approaches don't take into direct consideration.},

   abstract = {Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a fiber optics method that is revolutionizing the unconventional reservoir monitoring technology with substantial spatial coverage, high frequency data acquisition, and broad cable deployment options including hazardous/harsh environments compared to traditional geophysical methods such as point sensors (i.e., geophones). However, a single well equipped with fiber cannot acquire the far-field strain response since the sensitivity of this technique is restricted to a region near the monitor well. In this paper, we develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to estimate the magnitude of the far-field DAS response for any spatio-temporal input. Moreover, we identify a discontinuity in displacement results following fracture hit, which is interpreted as an effect of rock plastic deformation, and for the first time we demonstrate that it may be related to fracture width. Therefore, the output of our algorithm is used to estimate such geometric property along time in multiple locations. We generate the tangent displacement component (uy) (parallel to monitor well) using an in-house code based on Displacement Discontinuity Method (DDM). Several monitor wells are incorporated in the simulation of physical scenarios characterized by single and multiple hydraulic fractures. For each specific scenario we train and test an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with position and time as input variables, and axial displacement as output. The Machine Learning (ML) model is designed with 7 hidden layers, 100 the maximum number of neurons per layer and hyperbolic tangent as activation function. Finally, predicted uy is used to: (1) obtain Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data deriving it sequentially in space and time; and (2) estimate fracture width based on discontinuity magnitude. Training stage is performed avoiding overfitting and minimizing ANN loss function. In the testing phase, error between true and predicted variables is negligible in the entire waterfall plot region, except at initial time steps where fracture treatment starts at operation well and magnitude of axial displacement collected at monitor well is very small on the order of 10-6 or even lower. In this case, we suspect that these tiny supervisor values may have minimal impact on the loss function, and consequently weights and biases of regression model are barely updated to consider the effect of such outputs. Regarding fracture width estimation, error reduces consistently along time at all locations reaching values near 0%. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that creates a ML algorithm able to estimate strain fields generated during hydraulic fracturing treatments merely based on position and time inputs. The model developed with synthetic data is an incentive for the deployment of multiple monitor wells in the field to enhance beyond the near wellbore region geometric characterization of created fracture systems, and possibly identify critical patterns associated with fracture propagation that ultimately can lead to production optimization.},

   abstract = {Global probabilistic inversion within the latent space learned by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been recently demonstrated. Compared to inversion on the original model space, using the latent space of a trained GAN can offer the following benefits: (1) the generated model proposals are geostatistically consistent with the prescribed prior training image (TI), and (2) the parameter space is reduced by orders of magnitude compared to the original model space. Nevertheless, exploring the learned latent space by state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may still require a large computational effort. As an alternative, parameters in this latent space could possibly be optimized with much less computationally expensive gradient-based methods. This study shows that due to the typically highly nonlinear relationship between the latent space and the associated output space of a GAN, gradient-based deterministic inversion may fail even when considering a linear forward physical model. We tested two deterministic inversion approaches: a quasi-Newton gradient descent using the Adam algorithm and a Gauss–Newton (GN) method that makes use of the Jacobian matrix calculated by finite-differencing. For a channelized binary TI and a synthetic linear crosshole ground penetrating radar (GPR) tomography problem involving 576 measurements with low noise, we observe that when allowing for a total of 10,000 iterations only 13% of the gradient descent trials locate a solution that has the required data misfit. The tested GN inversion was unable to recover a solution with the appropriate data misfit. Our results suggest that deterministic inversion performance strongly depends on the inversion approach, starting model, true reference model, number of iterations and noise realization. In contrast, computationally-expensive probabilistic global optimization based on differential evolution always finds an appropriate solution.},

   abstract = {Spatial undersampling is a common problem in actual seismic data due to limitations in seismic survey environments, which can be satisfactorily solved by data regularization. The convolution-based deep-learning reconstruction methods require fewer assumptions than the conventional reconstruction methods (e.g., Curvelet-domain and F-X domain data regularization methods). However, the traditional convolution methods are not suitable for the large percentages of missing data. In this study, we propose an improved partial convolution-based (PConv-based) deep-learning network to reconstruct the missing data, which is evolved from the conventional convolution-based (CConv-based) method. The U-net is used as deep learning network to analyze both PConv-based method and CConv-based method. The PConv-based method adopts a hierarchical, regional-learning mechanism to dynamically update the constrained convolution results for the sample matrix. Hence, the problem of poor amplitude preservation in the data reconstruction has been addressed when multiple consecutive traces are missing. The influence of data loss ratio on reconstruction algorithm is also discussed in this study. The numerical test demonstrates that the trained network is able to process a sample dataset with 50% data lost and largely eliminate the noises in the frequency-wavenumber domain caused by the missing data. This proposed method is further evaluated by actual data, and the results are better than those obtained from the Curvelet-domain method. Moreover, the dataset reconstructed by the PConv-based deep-learning network has a great agreement with the original dataset in terms of amplitude.},

   abstract = {In the Hugoton Embayment of southwestern Kansas, St. Louis Limestone reservoirs have relatively low recovery efficiencies, attributed to the heterogeneous nature of the oolitic deposits. This study establishes quantitative relationships between digital well logs and core description data, and applies these relationships in a probabilistic sense to predict lithofacies in 90 uncored wells across the Big Bow and Sand Arroyo Creek fields. In 10 wells, a single hidden-layer neural network based on digital well logs and core described lithofacies of the limestone depositional texture was used to train and establish a non-linear relationship between lithofacies assignments from detailed core descriptions and selected log curves. Neural network models were optimized by selecting six predictor variables and automated cross-validation with neural network parameters and then used to predict lithofacies on the whole data set of the 2023 half-foot intervals from the 10 cored wells with the selected network size of 35 and a damping parameter of 0.01. Predicted lithofacies results compared to actual lithofacies displays absolute accuracies of 70.37-90.82%. Incorporating adjoining lithofacies, within-one lithofacies improves accuracy slightly (93.72%). Digital logs from uncored wells were batch processed to predict lithofacies and probabilities related to each lithofacies at half-foot resolution corresponding to log units. The results were used to construct interpolated cross-sections and useful depositional patterns of St. Louis lithofacies were illustrated, e.g., the concentration of oolitic deposits (including lithofacies 5 and 6) along local highs and the relative dominance of quartz-rich carbonate grainstone (lithofacies 1) in the zones A and B of the St. Louis Limestone. Neural network techniques are applicable to other complex reservoirs, in which facies geometry and distribution are the key factors controlling heterogeneity and distribution of rock properties. Future work involves extension of the neural network to predict reservoir properties, and construction of three-dimensional geo-models. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This allows for the management of professional output, the efficient interpretation of data, and completion of scientific research on data collected in geologically distinct regions. Machine learning methods and applications integrate large sets of information with the goal of efficient pattern recognition and the capability of leveraging accurate decision making. The objective of this study is to apply machine learning methods to the supervised classification of lithologies using multivariate log parameter data from offshore wells from the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). According to the analysis of the lithologies proposed in the IODP Expeditions and for the application of our methods, the lithologies were divided into four groups. The IODP Expeditions were organized into four templates for better results in analyzing the set of expeditions and practical application of the methods. The templates were submitted to training, validation, and testing by multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The evaluation was randomly divided into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) using the classification methods as an evaluation of the results. In the results, it was observed that Template1 (IODP Expedition 362) obtained better results with the MLP method, Template2 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, and 359) and Template3 (IODP Expeditions 354, 355, 359, and 362) obtained better results with the random forest method with greater than 80.00% accuracy. For cross-validation, the random forest method performed well in all scenarios. In the practical template, the G2 group obtained a better result with the MLP method with an average accuracy above 85.00%. It is expected that machine learning methods can help improve the study of geology with accurate and rapid answers related to interpreting collected data in different study regions.},

   abstract = {Accurately modeling and constructing a geologically realistic subsurface model remains an outstanding problem as the morphology controls the flow behaviors. Particularly, one of the pattern-based methods, namely cross-correlation based simulation, has been proved to be an effective way to reconstruct a realistic model, at both small and large scales. However, conditioning to point data in the large-scale problems is still a crucial issue in these algorithms, since there is always a trade-off between the quality of the realizations and the degree of point data reproduction. Specifically, it is not practical to build a training image (TI) which includes all the possibilities and variabilities. Therefore, finding a pattern that can represent the point data and, at the same time, preserving the connectivities is difficult. This leads to producing highly-connected realizations with a significant mismatch or poor models with a reasonable degree of point data reproduction. To accurately reproduce the densely distributed hard data, pixel-based methods can also produce some unrealistic artifacts around the hard data. In this paper, to overcome this challenge, however, we use pattern-based methods as they often produce more disconnected geobodies when dealing with dense hard data, and proposed a hybrid algorithm using the pattern-based methods and convolutional neural network (CNN). The trained CNN model is utilized to improve the quality of conditioning to point data for the original realizations generated by the pattern-based algorithm. As such, the mismatch locations are identified, and the same regions are used in the training of CNN to mimic the procedure through which a missing region can be filled. To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm, it is tested on cases with different dimensions and different numbers of facies. Then, the newly improved realizations are compared with the initial realizations generated by the pattern-based algorithm. The comparison is also conducted by the flow simulation test. And it indicates that the proposed hybrid algorithm can better reproduce the point data, while the connectivities are better preserved.},

This is done by training a neural network to generate samples from the data distribution using a recent deep learning technique called generative adversarial networks. By emulating the data generating process, the relevant statistics of the data are replicated. The method is assessed in subsurface flow problems, where effective parametrization of underground properties such as permeability is important due to the high dimensionality and presence of high spatial correlations. We experiment with realizations of binary channelized subsurface permeability and perform uncertainty quantification and parameter estimation. Results show that the parametrization using generative adversarial networks is very effective in preserving visual realism as well as high order statistics of the flow responses, while achieving a dimensionality reduction of two orders of magnitude.},

Here, we use a deep neural network of the variational autoencoder type to construct a parametric low-dimensional base model parameterization of complex binary geological media. For inversion purposes, it has the attractive feature that random draws from an uncorrelated standard normal distribution yield model realizations with spatial characteristics that are in agreement with the training set. In comparison with the most commonly used parametric representations in probabilistic inversion, we find that our dimensionality reduction (DR) approach outperforms principle component analysis (PCA), optimization-PCA (OPCA) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) DR techniques for unconditional geostatistical simulation of a channelized prior model. For the considered examples, important compression ratios (200–500) are achieved. Given that the construction of our parameterization requires a training set of several tens of thousands of prior model realizations, our DR approach is more suited for probabilistic (or deterministic) inversion than for unconditional (or point-conditioned) geostatistical simulation. Probabilistic inversions of 2D steady-state and 3D transient hydraulic tomography data are used to demonstrate the DR-based inversion. For the 2D case study, the performance is superior compared to current state-of-the-art multiple-point statistics inversion by sequential geostatistical resampling (SGR). Inversion results for the 3D application are also encouraging.},

Accurate leakage estimation is essential to assess the effectiveness of CO2 sequestration and groundwater protection. We developed reduced-order models to accurately and quickly estimate the CO2 and oil components (e.g., CH4) leakages from the abandoned wells. We conducted a wellbore leakage analysis for the CO2-EOR field. We designed a numerical model with an aquifer, caprock, and reservoir components. We used C1, C4, and C10 to represent the light, intermediate and heavy components of crude oil, respectively. We quantified the CO2/oil components leakage through the wellbore to the aquifer. Then, we performed Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the inherited uncertainty in the model parameters. After that, we developed and compared the performance of a set of reduced-order models (ROMs) to predict CO2/oil component leakages through an abandoned wellbore. In addition to a large amount of CO2 leakage, we observed that hydrocarbons leakage through the wellbore poses a potential risk of groundwater contamination. In addition, we observed that CO2 and hydrocarbons leakage profiles are highly sensitive to the wellbore permeability. Moreover, we reported the performance of three ROM development techniques where we found that the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) surpasses both the linear regression and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. This is one of the first studies to quantitatively evaluate leakage profiles from CO2-EOR sites and draws attention to further investigation and analysis.},

This research is part of the National Risk Assessment Partnership (NRAP), a DOE project tasked with conducting risk and uncertainty analysis in the areas of reservoir performance, natural leakage pathways, wellbore integrity, groundwater protection, monitoring, and systems level modeling. Our approach applies a simulated annealing algorithm that searches the solution space by iteratively mutating potential monitoring designs. A user-defined leakage signature based on change from initial conditions is implemented to infer CO2 leakage had occurred. An example application was performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this method compared to an exhaustive search of the entire solution space. We accounted for uncertainty in the example by evaluating the performance of potential monitoring designs across a set of simulated leakage realizations. The example application approached the optimal time to leakage detection in a few minutes using a standard workstation, which was several orders of magnitude faster than an exhaustive search of the solution space, thus exhibiting efficiency and effectiveness. A user-friendly tool, DREAM (Designs for Risk Evaluation and Management), is being developed for use on personal computers to make this method accessible to stakeholders, regulators, and researchers.},

In the DSI procedure, posterior predictions of the CO2 saturation distribution are generated using simulation results for prior geostatistical model realizations along with observed data, which in this case derive from observations at monitoring wells. Posterior (history-matched) geological models are not constructed in the DSI method, so many of the complications that arise in traditional data assimilation methods are avoided. The DSI method treats quantities of interest (QoI), such as the CO2 saturation distribution in the top layer, as random variables. The posterior distribution for these QoI, conditioned to observed data, is formulated in the data space within a Bayesian framework. Samples from this posterior distribution are generated using the randomized maximum likelihood method. We also introduce a procedure to optimize the locations of monitoring wells using only prior-model simulation results. This approach is based on analytical DSI results, and determines monitoring well locations such that the reduction in expected posterior variance of a relevant quantity is maximized. The new DSI procedure is applied to three-dimensional heterogeneous aquifer models involving uncertainties in a wide range of geological parameters, including variogram orientation, porosity and permeability fields, and regional pressure gradient. Multiple monitoring scenarios, involving four to eight monitoring wells, are considered in the evaluation of our data space methodology. Application of DSI with optimal monitoring wells is shown to consistently reduce the posterior variance of average CO2 saturation in the top layer, and to provide detailed saturation fields in reasonable correspondence with the ‘true’ saturation distribution. Finally, we demonstrate consistent improvement in DSI predictions as data are collected from an increasing number of (optimized) monitoring wells.},

This study presents an optimization method for designing cost-effective GCS monitoring networks under model and parameter uncertainty. A binary integer programming problem (BIPP) is formulated to minimize both the total volume of leakage and the number of uncovered potentially leaky locations. The BIPP is demonstrated for selecting optimal monitoring locations in both homogeneous and heterogeneous formations. The sensitivity of monitoring design to a number of model and design parameters is investigated, while model structure and parameter uncertainties are incorporated through user-specified scenarios. Results suggest that the BIPP is a viable approach for identifying optimal sensing locations even when the number of design variables is relatively large (~105).

This study utilizes injection and monitoring measurements at the borehole locations and time-lapse seismic surveys. The proposed method is based on a stochastic approach to inverse problems with data assimilation, namely the ensemble smoother with multi-data assimilation. Ensemble-based methods are generally unfeasible when applied to large geophysical datasets, such as time-lapse seismic surveys. In the proposed approach, a machine learning method, namely the deep convolutional autoencoder, is applied to reduce the dimension of the seismic data. The ensemble smoother is then applied in a lower dimensional data space to predict the aquifer petrophysical properties. This method updated predictions of porosity and permeability every time new data, either seismic surveys or borehole data, are available, to reduce the uncertainty in the CO2 plume prediction.

A single inverse modeling and forecasting process using traditional physics-based approaches (e.g., Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation or Ensemble Kalman Filter) may take a few weeks for a large-scale CO2 storage model (~million grid cells) without leveraging any high-performance computing. To speed up this process, researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy's SMART Initiative (https://edx.netl.doe.gov/smart/) have developed multiple approaches that employ machine learning methods to integrate monitoring data into subsurface forecasts more rapidly than current physics-based inverse modeling workflows allow. These updated forecasts with the updated models from the inverse modeling (history matching) process will be used to provide site operators with decision support by generating real-time performance metrics of CO2 storage (e.g., CO2 plume and pressure area of review). Here, we present one such machine learning accelerated workflow that can speed up the inverse modeling and forecasting process by three orders of magnitude. First, we developed a deep learning (DL) model to predict the pressure/saturation evolution in large-scale storage reservoirs. A feature coarsening technique was applied to extract the most representative information and perform the training and prediction at the coarse scale, and to further recover the resolution at the fine scale by 2D piecewise cubic interpolation. The accuracy of the feature coarsening-based DL model is validated with a reservoir model (~1.34 million grid cells) built upon a Clastic Shelf storage site. The overall mean relative error between the ground truth and the predictions from DL workflow is no more than 0.2%. Thereafter, the feature coarsening based deep learning model was utilized as forward model in the inverse modeling process where a classical data assimilation approach, ES-MDA-GEO, was applied. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed deep learning assisted workflow for large-scale inverse modeling and forecasting was demonstrated with the Clastic Shelf storage model.},

Geological uncertainty leads to significant uncertainty in predicted risk metrics such as CO2 plume extent, CO2/brine leakage rates through wellbores, and impacts to drinking water quality in groundwater aquifers due to CO2/brine leakage, all of which will impact the approach for post injection site care (PISC). Pre-injection risk assessment can be used to quantify the amount of uncertainty in different predicted risk metrics. However, it cannot account for the potential value of monitoring data (e.g., CO2 saturation and pressure measurements) acquired during the operation of CO2 storage. In this study, we demonstrate how uncertainty in predicted risks can be reduced by performing monitoring data assimilation. An ensemble of geological reservoir models, constrained by direct measurements (such as permeability estimates from exploratory wells), are generated by geostatistical conditional simulation. As the monitoring data from the storage site become available, they are assimilated into models using a recently developed data assimilation method, ES-MDA with geometric inflation factors (ES-MDA-GEO). The reservoir models, calibrated through multiple data assimilation iterations, are used to predict future risks and reduction in their uncertainties. The proposed approach for the quantification of uncertainty reduction in risk assessment is demonstrated with two examples: a generalized 3D synthetic case and a synthetic field case based on the Rock Springs Uplift site in southwestern Wyoming.},

   abstract = {Carbon dioxide capture and geological storage is an enabling technology that will allow the continued use well into this century of fossil fuels, mainly coal, for power generation and combustion in industrial processes because they are relatively abundant, cheap, available and globally distributed, thus enhancing the security and stability of energy systems. Geological media suitable for CO2 storage through various physical and chemical trapping mechanisms must have the necessary capacity and injectivity, and must confine the CO2 and impede its lateral migration and/or vertical leakage to other strata, shallow potable groundwater, soils and/or atmosphere. Such geological media are mainly oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline aquifers that are found in sedimentary basins. Storage of gases, including CO2, in these media has been demonstrated on a commercial scale by enhanced oil recovery operations, natural gas storage and acid gas disposal. Some of the risks associated with CO2 capture and geological storage are similar to, and comparable with, any other industrial activity for which extensive safety and regulatory frameworks are in place. Specific risks associated with CO2 storage relate to the operational (injection) phase and to the post-operational phase, of which the risks of most concern are those posed by the potential for acute or chronic CO2 leakage from the storage site. Notwithstanding the global climate effect of CO2 returning to the atmosphere, the local risks to health and safety, environment and equity need to be properly assessed and managed. Currently there are very few operations in the world where CO2 is injected and stored in the ground, mostly if not exclusively as a by-product of an operation driven by other considerations than climate change, such as oil production or regulatory requirements regarding H2S. These operations show that there are no major technological barriers to CO2 geological storage, and that challenges and barriers lie elsewhere. A major challenge in the implementation of CO2 geological storage is the high cost of CO2 capture, particularly for dilute streams like those from power plants and industrial combustion processes. There are concerns that public opinion and public's acceptance or rejection of this technology will likely affect the large-scale implementation of CO2 geological storage. The current paucity of policy, legislation and a proper regulatory framework in most jurisdictions is presently the most significant barrier. The resolution of these challenges will affect the economics and financial risk of CO2 geological storage and will accelerate or delay the deployment of this technology for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

abstract = {The experience from CO2 injection at pilot projects (Frio, Ketzin, Nagaoka, US Regional Partnerships) and existing commercial operations (Sleipner, Snøhvit, In Salah, acid-gas injection) demonstrates that CO2 geological storage in saline aquifers is technologically feasible. Monitoring and verification technologies have been tested and demonstrated to detect and track the CO2 plume in different subsurface geological environments. By the end of 2008, approximately 20Mt of CO2 had been successfully injected into saline aquifers by existing operations. Currently, the highest injection rate and total storage volume for a single storage operation are approximately 1Mt CO2/year and 25Mt, respectively. If carbon capture and storage (CCS) is to be an effective option for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, commercial-scale storage operations will require orders of magnitude larger storage capacity than accessed by the existing sites. As a result, new demonstration projects will need to develop and test injection strategies that consider multiple injection wells and the optimisation of the usage of storage space. To accelerate large-scale CCS deployment, demonstration projects should be selected that can be readily employed for commercial use; i.e. projects that fully integrate the capture, transport and storage processes at an industrial emissions source.}

abstract = {Data-driven approaches and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are promising enough to be relied on even more than physics-based methods; their main feed is data which is the fundamental element of each phenomenon. These algorithms learn from data and unveil unseen patterns out of it. The petroleum industry as a realm where huge volumes of data are generated every second is of great interest to this new technology. As the oil and gas industry is in the transition phase to oilfield digitization, there has been an increased drive to integrate data-driven modeling and machine learning (ML) algorithms in different petroleum engineering challenges. ML has been widely used in different areas of the industry. Many extensive studies have been devoted to exploring AI applicability in various disciplines of this industry; however, lack of two main features is noticeable. Most of the research is either not practical enough to be applicable in real-field challenges or limited to a specific problem and not generalizable. Attention must be given to data itself and the way it is classified and stored. Although there are sheer volumes of data coming from different disciplines, they reside in departmental silos and are not accessible by consumers. In order to derive as much insight as possible out of data, the data needs to be stored in a centralized repository from where the data can be readily consumed by different applications.}

    abstract = "{Estimation of flow-related petrophysical properties from borehole geophysical measurements is challenging in the presence of spatially complex rocks. This paper develops best practices for permeability estimation by comparing results obtained with machine learning methods and conventional petrophysical models.We preprocess core data acquired in key wells that incorporate expert knowledge, depth-matched core porosity with log-calculated porosity, generated two support systems (core and log resolution), and trained with the predicted porosity and smoothed permeability.Feature engineering is implemented on the resulting data suite to select the well logs that best correlate with permeability. Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to generate latent-space well logs, from which models are trained to estimate permeability. From the latent space models, we perform regression using random forests, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural network, and Timur-Coates's model to estimate the logarithm of permeability. Finally, the uncertainty of the estimated permeability is calculated based on the validation variance function for the test set. Results are compared based on the relative standard error of permeability estimations. The methods are tested on data sets from both conventional and unconventional rocks.Results indicate that random forest and neural networks best estimate permeability from triple-combo well logs across a wide range of variation with an average of 16\\% relative standard error when using the original well logs. Estimations improve when using latent-space well logs with discrete wavelet transforms. Machine learning algorithms reduced the error to less than 13\\%, while implementing a fully-connected autoencoder resulted in less than 10\\% error using the core-resolved support system. We obtained a 5\\% average permeability estimations error in well-log resolution, a 50\\% further decrease compared to the core support. The Timur-Coates model/approach is the most reliable for data sets with a priori information about irreducible water saturation, yielding less than 22\\% relative standard error, yet it requires prior data classification to improve estimation accuracy.The new procedure is computationally efficient, with estimations obtained in less than 2 minutes of CPU time. Uncertainty estimates show that permeability calculations are accurate, as their distributions border the true values within ± 5 mD. However, it is important to note that training wells must cover the widest possible range of measurements and petrophysical properties, and core data are smoothed to well-log resolution to improve the estimation of permeability in test wells. Data normalization does not always improve machine-learning estimations, especially across very low or high permeability ranges, resulting in a 25\\% increase in permeability estimation error compared to non-normalized data.}",

    abstract = "{The effects of well locations and control parameters on reservoir responses is important during CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) and water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection. Oil recovery and CO2 storage capacity typically vary with respect to corresponding changes in WAG ratio, slug size, and injector locations. The relationships between control parameters and response variables are usually studied using compositional simulators. However, the computational expense required to run such simulators could hinder their applicability to optimization procedures requiring many evaluations. Surrogate models (proxies) provide inexpensive alternatives for approximating reservoir responses. In this study, a machine learning-based proxy is developed to predict responses to changes in location and control parameters during WAG injection.Slight adjustments in injector well locations, WAG ratio and slug size could yield dramatic changes in the objective function responses. This complex relationship between control parameters and reservoir-wide responses makes data-driven methods an attractive option. We extend a recently developed machine learning approach in which the primary predictors are physical well locations, and water and gas injection rates, and the primary response is net present value (NPV). Because of the complexity of the response surface, we augmented the predictor variables with well-to-well pairwise connectivities, injector block permeabilities and porosities, and initial injector block saturations. Connectivities are represented by ‘diffusive times of flight’ of the pressure front, which is computed using the Fast Marching Method. Training observations are obtained from a handful of compositional simulations. We then used the Extreme Gradient Boosting method (XGBoost) to build intelligent proxies for making predictions given any set of observations.We propose a hyperdimensional, simultaneous optimization of well locations and controls using a novel optimization scheme similar Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS). Our optimization scheme was developed to fully take advantage of the speed and statistical output of the proxy. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study in which the underlying geology is uncertain. Results show significant correlation between proxy predictions and reservoir simulations, which validates application of the trained proxy. In addition, we demonstrate that simultaneous optimization of location and controls yields improvements over a sequential approach without any significant increase in computational cost.}",
